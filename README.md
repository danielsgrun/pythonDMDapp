# pythonDMDapp

This package is intended to be employed for easily using a Vialux DMD with Python language.

Please, take a look at the "Python package" requirements in "requirements.txt" before installing the package. To install all of them, just run:

"pip install -r requirements.txt"

To install the "pythonDMDapp", go the the folder where "setup.py" is and run: "pip install ."

Other requirements:

-- ALP4.3 "suite" and "dll"s, from Vialux;

-- IDS software suite "full", from IDS;


It's necessary to put the Vialux's ALP4 "dll"s in the working directory (usually "anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\pythonDMDapp" for Windows users).

For a first run of some pre-set applications and map extractions, please refer to "/tests".
